# Translation Analysis Script

This script analyzes translation keys for all tables defined in the `interactivityConfiguration` and compares them with the existing translations in `translations.const.ts`.
It helps identify missing translation keys and key-value pairs that need to be added to the translation system.

## Run

```
# From ./app
npm run TranslationAnalysis:update
```
