# ngnix proxy cache

This folder holds the cached tiles of our vector tile endpoints.

- `docker-compose.network.yml` mounts a volume `./cache_proxy:/var/cache/nginx`
   - The container folder `/var/cache/nginx` (defined by nginx)
   - … writes its data into `/cache_proxy` (on the server)

- `docker-compose.yml` mounts a volume `./cache_proxy:/cache_nginx_proxy`
   - The data folder `/cache_proxy` (on the server)
   - … is made accessible in the container via `/cache_nginx_proxy`
   - Which is where we delete the data from in `processing/steps/cache.ts` to clear the cache.

We never run this during development, because we don't use the full docker setup locally.
We have to test this on staging.
